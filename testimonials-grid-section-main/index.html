                    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                    free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                    shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                    grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer

                code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding. It took  my learning to the next
                level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
                often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                recommend! ”
